# intention-rounding
Digitising the daily intention rounding process

Hi this is a project to digities the intention rounding proecss at the BRI ITU.

Requires the creation of a SQL database to function.

Inside the database using the SQL commands from the 'SQL commands to start database and tables' will require 2 separate tables to be created
One table is for the intention roudning data
The other table is for the intention rounding categories

As per the config.php file the database access details are as follows:

username: "root"

password: ""

These are the default login details which don't need to be defined if left undefined in the SQL database creation command

Please see the file 'SQL commands to start database and tables' for commands to create the necessary databases. This file also has a SQL command to add some starting categories for intention rounding - if these are old or not needed, the categories can be easily changed from the front end web page later

Hope this is helpful!
