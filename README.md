# intention-rounding
Digitising the daily intention rounding process

Hi this is a project to digities the intention rounding proecss at the BRI ITU.

Requires the creation of a SQL database to function

Please see the file 'SQL commands to start database and tables' for commands to create the necessary databases. This file also has a SQL command to add some starting categories for intention rounding - if these are old or not needed, the categories can be easily changed from the front end web page later

Hope this is helpful!
